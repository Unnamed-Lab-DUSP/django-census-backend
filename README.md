A mapping application that collates the Treasury's geographic criteria for the Inflation Reduction Act's low-income communities bonus energy investment credit program. Though this program, the IRA will provide additional percentage points of tax credits that supplement the Investment Tax Credit (ITC). It adds two additional geographic criteria used to priorize projects and allocate capacity: 1) location within a USDA-defined Persistent Poverty County, or 2) location within a census tract that is designated as disadvantaged in the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool.

We also include layers relevant to the Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus.
